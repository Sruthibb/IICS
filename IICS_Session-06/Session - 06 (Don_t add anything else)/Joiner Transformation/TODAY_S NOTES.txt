source tr     - you can join two or more homogeneoussource  tables only 

joiner tr       - you can join two or more heterogeneous sources and also homogeneous sources.


Joins supported by oracle
-------------------------
inner join/equi join/ normal join / join
non-equi join
left outer join
right outer join
full outer join
cross join 
self join

JOINER TR  - ACTIVE AND CONNECTED

USAGE : TO JOIN TWO OR MORE HETEROGENEOUS SOURCES 
ALSO WE CAN JOIN HOMOGENEOUS SOURCE TABLES.

WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF JOINS IT WILL SUPPORT IN  JOINER TR IN INFORMATICA ?

WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF JOINS IN INFORMATICA ?
4 TYPES OF JOINES

1. NORMAL JOIN        -- IF THE rows from the two tables matches a contion                  - INNER JOIN IN ORACLE.
2. MASTER OUTER JOIN  - MATCHING ROWS FROM MASTER , ALL THE RECORDS FROM DETAIL table       - RIGHT OUTER JOIN IN ORACLE
3. DETAIL OUTER JOIN   -- MATCHING RECORDS FROM DETAIL, ALL THE RECORDS FROM MASTER         - LEFT OUTER JOIN IN ORACLE 
4. FULL OUTER JOIN   ---  ALL THE RECORDS FROM THE BOTH THE TABLES.                         - FULL OUTER JOIN IN ORACLE.
                


MASTER OUTER JOIN IN INFORMATICA= RIGHT OUTER JOIN IN ORACLE
DETAIL OUTER JOIN IN INFORMATICA= LEFT OUTER JOIN IN ORACLE

detail : CUSTOMERS
master : ORDERS

normal join :  matching records from master (ORDERS) and details table (CUSTOMERS)

master outer join  : MATCHING ROWS FROM MASTER (ORDERS), ALL THE RECORDS FROM DETAIL(CUSTOMERS) table

DETAIL OUTER JOIN   -- MATCHING RECORDS FROM DETAIL(CUSTOMERS), ALL THE RECORDS FROM                 								MASTER( ORDERS)

full outer join  -  ALL THE RECORDS FROM THE BOTH THE TABLES  . MASTER (contacts) and DETAIL(CUSTOMERS) 



detail : ORDERS    -- 10L
master : customers   -1L


normal join :  matching records from master ( customers )and details table (ORDERS  )

master outer join  : MATCHING ROWS FROM MASTER (customers) , ALL THE RECORDS FROM DETAIL(ORDERS ) table

DETAIL OUTER JOIN   -- MATCHING RECORDS FROM DETAIL( ORDERS  ), ALL THE RECORDS FROM 												MASTER( customers   )

full outer join  -  ALL THE RECORDS FROM THE BOTH THE TABLES  . MASTER (ORDERS ) and DETAIL(contacts ) 

CUSOTMER TABLE  -- 10L
ORDERS_FF FILE   -- 10K  - MASTER 




- JOINER WILL SUPPORT ONLY EQUALITY OPERATOR IN JOIN CONDITION
- WE CAN GIVE MULTIPLE JOIN CONDITIONS.
- JOINER IS HAVING SORTED INPUT OPTION
- TO JOIN N SOURCES WE REQUIRED N-1 JOINER TRANSFORMATIONS ARE REQUIRED
- TO IMPORVE THE PERFORMANCE OF JOINER TR ,TAKE THE SOURCE WHICH HAS  LESS NUMBERS OF RECORDS
   AS MASTER SOURCE IN JOINER TRs IN THE MAPPING.
- TO IMPORVE THE PERFORMANCE TRY TO JOIN IN THE SOURCE TRASNFORMAION ITSELF WHENVER POSSIBLE.
- TWO TYPES OF CACHE  -  INDEX(CONDITON PORTS)  AND DATA CACHE (NON CONDITION COLUMNS)
- IN INFORMATICA YOU CANNOT NON-EQUI JOIN 


use the source with fewer( less number ) rows as the master source

JOINER INDEX CACHE  -- it will store  the ports in the joining condition
JOINER DATA CACHE    -- it will store the ports other than joining condition 



customers table - 100000   -- detail
orders FILE - 1000 -- master
